# anki-show-question
Add-on for anki that adds the ability to show the same question again after answering without submitting an ease.
This can be used to directly rewrite the answer, thus helping to memorize it.

The functionality of the easy-button is changed to show the question again. Also, a context-menu entry in the reviewer is added.

Only tested with version 2.1.49.
